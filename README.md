# Studier Obsidian
**Create quizzes for your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notes and learn better.** 


## Introduction

This Obsidian plugin lets you review your notes with quizzes. You can make your own questions for each note and customize how the plugin reads them, so it matches the style of your notes. The plugin randomly selects a markdown note and if there are questions in it, it prompts you with a quiz and the best part is you can easily check your answers. If there are no questions, the plugin will function like the Core plugin "Random Note".

### Creating questions for quizzes
Once you choose either option 1 or 2, a modal will show up with some questions. If not, you can just write your own questions in your note. It doesn't matter where you put them, as long as you stick to the formats you've chosen. Here are some examples you can use as a guide.
